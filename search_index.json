Since then, the CAMARADES have broadened their scope to other disease models such as neuropathic pain and Alzheimer’s disease. The CAMARADES has pioneered in the field of preclinical systematic review, and in addition to carrying out their own research, provide a supportive framework for other research groups performing systematic review. The team collaborates with researchers all around the world, including meta-researchers, preclinical researchers, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, publishers, funders and policymakers. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;images/camarades_logo.jpg&quot;) 1.1 Our missions Improve the validity of preclinical research Increase the value of preclinical research Improve translation from preclinical research to the clinic Conducting meta-research including systematic reviews and meta-analyses to investigate experimental validity across different preclinical research domains 1.2 Our strategies Developing guidance and providing methodological support for systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical data Developing our own systematic review platform, specifically designed for preclinical systematic reviews Developing new automation tools to assist systematic reviews and meta-analyses Promoting the sharing of data and data analysis tools Work with us "],["getting-started.html", "Chapter 2 Getting Started 2.1 CAMARADES 2.2 Translational failure 2.3 Why systematic reviews? 2.4 Using SyRF 2.5 Systematic review methodology 2.6 Data skills 2.7 R 2.8 Meta analysis 2.9 Data Visualisation", " Chapter 2 Getting Started Here is an growing list of resources you might find useful. 2.1 CAMARADES Head to the CAMARADES website for more information about our reseach projects and collaborations. 2.2 Translational failure Course: Edinburgh University Research Optimisation Course: course on improving preclinical research Log in to Learn Click on ‘self-enrol’ (top right of the screen) Scroll down to Research Improvement Click on EUROC (Edinburgh University Research Optimisation Course) 2.3 Why systematic reviews?

A few resources to help you with this process are highlighted below: Step-by-step guidefor identifying preclinical animal studies from our collaborators, SyRCLE This useful resource from the University of Tasmania 4.1.2 Downloading references to Endnote Endnote is our citation manager of choice within the team. It is fairly user-friendly, has lots of export formats, and can be used to find PDFs for citations. If you are a student at the university, you can request to download Endnote here 4.1.2.1 Pubmed Use the Advanced Search builder on Pubmed to search for relevant records. Click Send to and citation manager to import into Endnote directly. Troubleshooting: If you have &gt;10,000 records, you will have to do this multiple times. If this is the case, you can filter by year of publication by going to the PUBLICATION DATE filters on the right hand side and selecting Custom range. The publications over time bar plot on the right hand side should not be used for filtering - in our experience this has a lot of overlapping publications across years and the results do not total up correctly. In some cases, with very large numbers of records Endnote may crash during the download. If this happens, filter by Year in PubMed to split the records into smaller file sizes (e.g. 5,000 records) and import each one separately. 4.1.2.2 Web of Science Log in to WOS here To export up to 500 records at a time, select Export and Endnote desktop. Alternatively, the option may be available to you via your institution to download 5000 references at a time. If possible, select this option and download to a tab deliminted format. Once downloaded, you will need to import into excel to perform some data cleaning and formatting. In excel, select Data and From text to import the .txt file. The column headers must be changed to the following: PT - Reference Type AU - Author TI - Title SO - Secondary Title UT - Accession Number PD - Date PY - Year VL - Volume IS - Number TC (citation count) - If you want to keep this or any others call them Custom 1, Custom 2.. etc. For pages, you need to create a new column in excel called Pages. Enter a foruma that will add the contents of the BP (beginning page) and EP (ending page) columns with a “-” in the middle e.g. =E1&amp;“-”&amp;F1\" and paste down the column length. Once complete, copy paste this column and ensure it is pasted as the values, so you can delete the BP and EP columns. Finally, insert a row above the column names with Generic* in cell A1. Save as a tab delimited text file. Open up in Notepad and remove any tabs after the Generic* so that Reference Type begins on a new line but with no tabs in between. Now, go to Endnote and import the file by going to File -&gt; Import -&gt; File and selecting Import option Tab Delimited. Before improting, select UTF-8 for text-translation, and Import All duplicates. 4.1.2.3 EMBASE Log in to Embase here In the Range field, enter 1-5000 to download 5000 records at a time (or whichever limit your institution allows). Do not click Go and instead click Export. Export references in Endnote format and once downloaded, click the file to import into Endnote automatically. Alternatively, right click the file and select Endnote under the Open with… list. 4.2 Removing duplicates If you conduct a systematic search across multiple databases, you will need to remove duplicate records - e.g. the same record which has been identified in several databases. This is not a straightforward task, as the same record may differ slightly in title, authors, and other reference information due to the way it has been indexed in different databases. Endnote is a popular tool for duplicate removal, however there is evidence that it is not sufficient and misses many duplicates. 4.2.1 ASySD The Automated Systematic Search Deduplicator ASySD was developed within CAMARADES to address this problem automatically remove duplicate references. First, export your records as an .XML file from Endnote and upload to ASySD. Next, move to the next “Deduplication” tab to remove duplicate records. There is also an option of completing manual deduplication (where the algorithm detects pairs of records which might be duplicates). Follow the instructions on the application to select the IDs of records you wish to remove from any pair and click to remove records from dataset when complete. On the final tab, you can download your unique systematic search dataset in multiple formats. We recommend downloading the Endnote tab delimited (.txt) file and importing to a new Endnote library. 4.2.2 Endnote 4.3 Screening for inclusion 4.4 Extracting information 4.5 Extracting numerical data 4.6 Summarising your results "],["meta-analysis-1.html", "Chapter 5 Meta-analysis 5.1 Background 5.2 Cleaning SyRF data 5.3 Combine effect sizes 5.4 Explore heterogeneity 5.5 Small study effects", " Chapter 5 Meta-analysis 5.1 Background 5.2 Cleaning SyRF data 5.3 Combine effect sizes 5.3.1 Which method is best? 5.3.2 Visualise effects 5.3.3 Interpreting forest plots 5.4 Explore heterogeneity 5.5 Small study effects "],["automation.html", "Chapter 6 Automation 6.1 Background 6.2 Automating searches 6.3 Automating deduplication 6.4 Automating screening 6.5 Automating data extraction 6.6 SOLES projects", " Chapter 6 Automation 6.1 Background 6.2 Automating searches 6.3 Automating deduplication 6.4 Automating screening 6.5 Automating data extraction 6.6 SOLES projects "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
