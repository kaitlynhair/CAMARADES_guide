A few resources to help you with this process are highlighted below: Step-by-step guidefor identifying preclinical animal studies from our collaborators, SyRCLE This useful resource from the University of Tasmania 4.2 Downloading references from PubMed to Endnote Use the Advanced Search builder on Pubmed to search for relevant records. Send to Citation manager to import into Endnote directly. If you have &gt;10,000 records, you will have to do this multiple times. In some cases, with very large numbers of records Endnote may crash. If this happens, filter by Year in PubMed to split the records into smaller file sizes (e.g. 5,000 records) and import each one separately. 4.2.1 Downloading references from Web of Science to Endnote Log in to WOS here To export up to 500 records at a time, select Export and Endnote desktop. Alternatively, the option may be available to you via your institution to download 5000 references at a time. If possible, select this option and download to a tab deliminted format. Once downloaded, you will need to import into excel to perform some data cleaning and formatting. In excel, select Data and From text to import the .txt file. The column headers must be changed to the following: PT - Reference Type AU - Author TI - Title SO - Secondary Title UT - Accession Number PD - Date PY - Year VL - Volume IS - Number TC (citation count) - If you want to keep this or any others call them Custom 1, Custom 2.. etc. For pages, you need to create a new column in excel called Pages. Enter a foruma that will add the contents of the BP (beginning page) and EP (ending page) columns with a “-” in the middle e.g. =E1&amp;\"-\"&amp;F1\" and paste down the column length. Once complete, copy paste this column and ensure it is pasted as the values, so you can delete the BP and EP columns. Finally, insert a row above the column names with *Generic in cell A1. Save as a tab delimited text file. Open up in Notepad and remove any tabs after the *Generic so that Reference Type begins on a new line but with no tabs in between. Now, go to Endnote and import the file by going to File -&gt; Import -&gt; File and selecting Import option Tab Delimited. Before improting, select UTF-8 for text-translation, and Import All duplicates. 4.2.2 Downloading references from EMBASE to Endnote Log in to Embase here In the Range field, enter 1-5000 to download 5000 records at a time (or whichever limit your institution allows). Do not click Go and instead click Export. Export references in Endnote format and once downloaded, click the file to import into Endnote automatically. Alternatively, right click the file and select Endnote under the Open with... list. "],["dealing-with-duplicate-citations.html", "Chapter 5 Dealing with duplicate citations 5.1 Deduplication", " Chapter 5 Dealing with duplicate citations If you conduct a systematic search across multiple databases, you will need to remove duplicate records - e.g. the same record which has been identified in several databases. This is not a straightforward task, as the same record may differ slightly in title, authors, and other reference information due to the way it has been indexed in different databases. Endnote is a popular tool for duplicate removal, however there is evidence that it is not sufficient and misses many duplicates. 5.1 Deduplication 5.1.1 Deduplication using ASySD (Automated Systematic Search Deduplication Tool) The ASySD tool was developed within CAMARADES to address this problem automatically remove duplicate references. First, export your records as an .XML file from Endnote and upload to ASySD. Next, move to the next “Deduplication” tab to remove duplicate records. There is also an option of completing manual deduplication (where the algorithm detects pairs of records which might be duplicates). Follow the instructions on the application to select the IDs of records you wish to remove from any pair and click to remove records from dataset when complete. On the final tab, you can download your unique systematic search dataset in multiple formats. We recommend downloading the Endnote tab delimited (.txt) file and importing to a new Endnote library.
