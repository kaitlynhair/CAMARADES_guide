You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],

There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section.a 2.2 Developing search terms Developing optimal search terms to identify all potentially relevant studies is a hugely important step in your systematic review. A few resources to help you with this process are highlighted below: Step-by-step guidefor identifying preclinical animal studies from our collaborators, SyRCLE This useful resource from the University of Tasmania 2.3 Downloading references from PubMed to Endnote Use the Advanced Search builder on Pubmed to search for relevant records. Send to Citation manager to import into Endnote directly. If you have &gt;10,000 records, you will have to do this multiple times. In some cases, with very large numbers of records Endnote may crash. If this happens, filter by Year in PubMed to split the records into smaller file sizes (e.g. 5,000 records) and import each one separately. 2.4 Downloading references from Web of Science to Endnote Log in to WOS here To export up to 500 records at a time, select Export and Endnote desktop. Alternatively, the option may be available to you via your institution to download 5000 references at a time. If possible, select this option and download to a tab deliminted format. Once downloaded, you will need to import into excel to perform some data cleaning and formatting. In excel, select Data and From text to import the .txt file. The column headers must be changed to the following: PT - Reference Type AU - Author TI - Title SO - Secondary Title UT - Accession Number PD - Date PY - Year VL - Volume IS - Number TC (citation count) - If you want to keep this or any others call them Custom 1, Custom 2.. etc. For pages, you need to create a new column in excel called Pages. Enter a foruma that will add the contents of the BP (beginning page) and EP (ending page) columns with a “-” in the middle e.g. =E1&amp;\"-\"&amp;F1\" and paste down the column length. Once complete, copy paste this column and ensure it is pasted as the values, so you can delete the BP and EP columns. Finally, insert a row above the column names with *Generic in cell A1. Save as a tab delimited text file. Open up in Notepad and remove any tabs after the *Generic so that Reference Type begins on a new line but with no tabs in between. Now, go to Endnote and import the file by going to File -&gt; Import -&gt; File and selecting Import option Tab Delimited. Before improting, select UTF-8 for text-translation, and Import All duplicates. 2.5 Downloading references from EMBASE to Endnote Log in to Embase here In the Range field, enter 1-5000 to download 5000 records at a time (or whichever limit your institution allows). Do not click Go and instead click Export. Export references in Endnote format and once downloaded, click the file to import into Endnote automatically. Alternatively, right click the file and select Endnote under the Open with... list. 2.6 Duplicate references If you conduct a systematic search across multiple databases, you will need to remove duplicate records - e.g. the same record which has been identified in several databases. This is not a straightforward task, as the same record may differ slightly in title, authors, and other reference information due to the way it has been indexed in different databases. Endnote is a popular tool for duplicate removal, however there is evidence that it is not sufficient and misses many duplicates. 2.7 Deduplication using ASySD (Automated Systematic Search Deduplication Tool) The ASySD tool was developed within CAMARADES to address this problem automatically remove duplicate references. First, export your records as an .XML file from Endnote and upload to ASySD. Next, move to the next “Deduplication” tab to remove duplicate records. There is also an option of completing manual deduplication (where the algorithm detects pairs of records which might be duplicates). Follow the instructions on the application to select the IDs of records you wish to remove from any pair and click to remove records from dataset when complete. On the final tab, you can download your unique systematic search dataset in multiple formats. We recommend downloading the Endnote tab delimited (.txt) file and importing to a new Endnote library. "]
